# File Store Application

A simple file store application consisting of a backend API and a CLI client. The backend API uses Go's `net/http` package, and the CLI client is built using `cobra`. The application allows you to add, retrieve, update, and delete text files, as well as perform word count and frequency analysis across all stored files.

---

## Requirements
- **Go**: Version 1.16 or higher. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Cobra**: For the CLI application. [Install Cobra CLI](https://github.com/spf13/cobra#installing)
- **Docker**: Required for containerization and running containerized applications. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filestore.git
   cd filestore
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies: Install cobra for the CLI application:**
   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra
   ```

---

## Usage
### Starting the Server
1. **Navigate to the server directory and run the server:**
   ```bash
   cd cmd/file-server
   go run main.go
   ```
2. **The server will start on port 8080.**
### Building the CLI
1. **Navigate to the cli directory and build the CLI application:**
   ```bash
   cd cmd/store-client
   go build -o store main.go
   ```
2. **This will create an executable named store.**

## Commands
1. **Add Files**   
   Upload one or more files to the store:

   ```bash
   ./store add file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

2. **List Files**   
   List all files stored on the server:

   ```bash
   ./store ls
   ```

3. **Get File Content**   
   Retrieve the content of a specific file:

   ```bash
   ./store get file1.txt
   ```

4. **Update File**   
   Update the content of an existing file or add a new file:

   ```bash
   ./store update file1.txt
   ```

5. **Delete File**   
   Remove a file from the store:

   ```bash
   ./store rm file1.txt
   ```

6. **Word Count**   
   Get the total word count across all stored files:

   ```bash
   ./store wc
   ```

7. **Frequent Words**   
   Display the most or least frequent words across all files:

   ```bash
   ./store freq-words [--limit|-n NUMBER] [--order=asc|dsc]
   ```


## Examples
1. **Adding Files**
     ```bash
     echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
     echo "Go is awesome" > go.txt
     ./store add hello.txt go.txt
     ```
2. **Listing Files**
    ```bash
    ./store ls
    ```
3. **Retrieving File Content**
    ```bash
    ./store get hello.txt
    ```
4. **Updating a File**
    ```bash
    echo "Hello Go" > hello.txt
    ./store update hello.txt
    ./store get hello.txt
    ```
5. **Deleting a File**
    ```bash
    ./store rm go.txt
    ./store ls
    ```
6. **Word Count**
    ```bash
    ./store wc
    ```
7. **Frequent Words**
    ```bash
    ./store freq-words -n 5 --order=dsc
    ```

## Docker:
You can also try using the Docker build
### Step 1:
   ```bash
   docker build . -t fileserver
   ```

### Step 2:
```bash
docker run -p 8081:8080 fileserver:latest
```

One would see the following logs and can access the server at `localhost:8081/files`
`2024/12/03 06:31:10 Server is running on port 8080...`


## Kubernetes

To deploy on a Kubernetes cluster, we need to do a docker build and push to one's registry. Make sure the image is publicly available.
Use kustomize tool and replace your image name accordingly in the kustomize.yaml. 
These steps are tried on a Kind cluster:

### Step 1. 
```bash
kubectl apply -k kube/config
```
You would see
```
service/file-store-service created
deployment.apps/file-store-deployment created
```
âžœ  To get the deployments:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
You would see
```plaintext
NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
file-store-deployment   1/1     1            1           31s
```
  
### Step 2. Check for pods in the same namespace using kubectl get pods and make sure the containers in the pod are up& running
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
You would see
```plaintext
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
file-store-deployment-7f9dd45957-pj2pd   1/1     Running   0          10s
```

### Step 3. Do a kubectl portforward service/file-service be able to access it outside the kind cluster

```bash
kubectl port-forward services/file-store-service 8080:8080
```
You would see:
```plaintext
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080
```

### Step 4. Verify using curl
```
curl http://localhost:8080/files  
```
